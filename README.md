#AndersonBookShop

I built this project using ASP.NET MVC 5 and SQL Server 2019.
AndersonBookShop is a bookstore management web app using which a bookstore keeps track
of the stock it wishes to maintain in-house.
Using this web app the bookstore may add new books, edit existing ones, delete books,
and also look up book details.
For the data, I wrote SQL queries that access the data tables I created
using SQL Server Management Studio
